No Man's Access - A computer vision model to generate text to speach functionality for visually imapired accesibility.
=======================================================================================================================================                                                                                                                               

Overview:
This is a computer vision model that uses a YOLOv8 model trained on captured images from Hello Games "No Man's Sky". The game currentley
does not have built in screen reader functionality and also does not function well with windows built in screen magnifier software making
the game difficult to play for visually impaired players. 

Installation/Setup Instructions:
This script requires Python, and was created using version 3.9. Newer versions caused dependency module error resulting in the program not functioning.
NVIDIA CUDA technology is used by default and is required for proper performance, CPU operation is possible but results in poor performance.

Prerequist Installaion:
1. Install Python 3.9 from the python.org website
2. Install NVIDIA CUDA 12.4 runtime via: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-0-download-archive

Virtual Environment Setup (optional):
1. In a Windows Command Prompt, navigate to the root "NoMansAccess" folder.
2. Create a virtual environment by running the following command:
    py -3.9 -m venv .venv
3. Activate the created virtual environment by running the following command.
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
4. Update pip and install ultralytics using pip by running:
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install ultralytics
5. The included version of torch and torchvision is incorrect and will need to be uninstalled first by running this command.
    pip uninstall torch torchvision
6. Install an appropriate verson of torch using the command generated by https://pytorch.org/
    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
7. Install the remaining Python modules with the following command.
    pip install pyfiglet keyboard easyocr pyttsx3
8. Run NoMansAccess.py, the first run will take a short time before the application being ready for use but will initialize faster on following runs.


Change Lop:
v0.1
    Initial push with base line functionality.
